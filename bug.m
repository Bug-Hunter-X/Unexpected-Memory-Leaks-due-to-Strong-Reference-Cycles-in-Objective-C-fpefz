In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, strong reference cycles can occur unexpectedly, leading to memory leaks.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

If `myObject` in `AnotherClass` and `anotherObject` in `MyClass` strongly reference each other, a retain cycle is created. Neither object will ever be deallocated, even if no other part of the application holds a strong reference to them.
